Lionel Messi, originally from Argentina,  became the Spanish league's all-time leading scorer with 253 goals on Saturday which is yet another reason to consider him among the very best football players ever.

Messi scored a hat trick to lead Barcelona's 5-1 rout of Sevilla.  He surpassed the previous mark of 251 goals that Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra set in 271 La Liga games from 1940-55.

This was his 289th league game, and the 27-year-old Messi first equaled Zarra's record in the 21st minute and then beat it in the 72nd at Camp Nou Stadium. He went on to get his treble in the 78th with his 253rd league goal.

Spanish league featured some of the world's most talented attacking players through its 83 seasons, including Diego Maradona, Alfredo di Stefano, Johan Cruyff and Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi stands alone as its most potent scorer after bettering a milestone that had stood untouched for almost 60 years.
